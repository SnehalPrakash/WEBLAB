        <p>Bacalhau, or salted cod, is a staple of Portuguese cuisine, with a history deeply tied to Portugal’s maritime past. Known as the “faithful friend,” this fish is said to have over 365 recipes—one for each day of the year! Bacalhau à Brás, a mixture of shredded cod, onions, potatoes, and eggs, is a popular version. Traditionally salted and dried, bacalhau was once an essential food for sailors and is now enjoyed nationwide. Its unique texture and flavor make it a versatile dish, enjoyed in soups, stews, and baked recipes, and often served with olive oil, garlic, and fresh herbs.</p>

        <p>Pastéis de Nata, Portugal’s beloved custard tarts, are a culinary delight that originated in Lisbon in the 19th century. With a flaky, buttery crust and a creamy, cinnamon-dusted custard center, these tarts are enjoyed by locals and tourists alike. Pastéis de Belém, where the recipe was first popularized, remains a landmark, drawing crowds to sample the iconic pastry. These tarts are traditionally enjoyed with a sprinkle of powdered sugar and cinnamon, and they pair perfectly with coffee. Found in bakeries throughout Portugal, pastéis de nata are a sweet symbol of Portuguese baking mastery.</p>
